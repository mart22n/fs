# fs
An EF Core &amp; MariaDB file storage. Latest development in dev branch. NB! The project compiles with warnings, and does not do anything useful currently. The connection string can be provided as "ConnString" key in app.config in project root, syntax:

```xml
<configuration>
    <appSettings>
    <add key="ConnString" value="..." />
  </appSettings>
</configuration>
```
